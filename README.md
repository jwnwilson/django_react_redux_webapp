## Build status

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jwnwilson/django_react_redux_webapp.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/jwnwilson/django_react_redux_webapp)

## Description

My personal website rebuilt using:

- Django 1.11
- React 
- Redux
- Wagtail CMS
- Django Restful API
- Docker
- circleCI
- Kubernetes (ish)

Features:
- CMS to power Django Restful API
- API data to power a modular react app
- Modular React Front end with code spliting, each reach component is loaded as needed
- Setup as a PWA with limit offline support
- Server side rendering and SEO optimisation for react app

This is my attempt to build a reusable project to build any type of website I need, completely over-engineered for learning and fun but also I can take parts of it away and use in other project. I also wanted to use this project to see how many pieces of tech I could glue together to see how well they worked together, I think the results I got have been better than I expected.

## Setup

To start a local dev server for the front end and backend run:

$  make build

$  make run

## SSR

To setup SSR:

- change "ENV=production" in web.env
- run make build-fe && make collect-static
- start the services with "make run"
- run the prerender command "make prerender"

## To Do

- Move from heroku to GCE / AWS / Digital ocean for multiple processes cheaply
- Setup worker to prerender html
- Setup modpagespeed nginx settings
- Fix test --nomigrations
- Investigate javascript Flow
- Add tests for FE and BE
- Add pagination on FE
- Remove jquery replace with modular libraries
- Investigate integration tests Cyprus
- Separate Snippets in CMS by tags
